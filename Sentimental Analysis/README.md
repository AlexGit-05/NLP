The R script processes Twitter data about Qatar by cleaning tweets (removing URLs, hashtags, and unwanted characters) and analyzing their emotional content using sentiment analysis. The algorithm tokenizes the cleaned text, removes common stop words, applies the NRC sentiment lexicon to categorize the emotional tone of tweets, and creates custom dictionaries for Qatar-specific themes, ultimately exporting the results to Excel and CSV files.
