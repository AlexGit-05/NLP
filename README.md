Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a useful way. It combines linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding. NLP encompasses various tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, speech recognition, and text generation. At its core, NLP works by breaking down language into smaller pieces, analyzing the relationships between these pieces, and applying statistical models and deep learning algorithms to understand context and meaning. These techniques allow computers to perform tasks like understanding the emotional tone of text, translating between languages, answering questions, summarizing documents, and even generating human-like responses. Applications of NLP are widespread, from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to email spam filters, autocomplete suggestions, and language translation services.
